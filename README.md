# 📚 Library Management API

A RESTful API built using Java to manage library operations including Books, Members, and Loans with structured CRUD operations and fine calculation logic.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Library Management API is designed to simulate real-world library operations by providing endpoints to manage books, register members, and track loan records efficiently.

This project demonstrates strong understanding of:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- REST API Development
- CRUD Operations
- JSON Data Handling
- Error Handling & Validation
- API Testing using Postman

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Backend: Java
- Architecture: REST API
- Data Format: JSON
- Testing Tool: Postman
- Version Control: Git & GitHub

---

## ✨ Features

### 📘 Book Module
